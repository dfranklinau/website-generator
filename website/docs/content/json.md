There may be instances where a section or page will benefit from referencing an
external data source. website-generator supports loading JSON and making its
contents available in templates.

Create a JSON file with the file name `_data_.json` to include data that is
accessible to any sections or pages in the same directory.

The JSON data will be accessible in a `data` variable (see [Template
variables](/website-generator/templates#data)).
